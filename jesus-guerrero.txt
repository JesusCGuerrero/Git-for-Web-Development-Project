Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
		An inline element does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of the page. It is usually used with other elements.
		A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the page. It also has a line break before and after the element.
		inline element examples:
			<a>
			<span>
		Block-Level Element Examples:
			<div>
			<h1>
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
		The element is positioned relative to its first positioned ancestor element. It can be placed anywhere.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
		Make it a display inline-block element. 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
		Block:
			<div>
			<p>
			<h1>
		Inline:
			<a>
			<span>
		Inline-Block:
			<button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
		The box model is essentially the idea that in CSS every element is wrapped in a box. This box is made up of the content at the center, then padding, border and margin in that order.
		It allows us to add borders around elements and define the space between them.
		You must calculate and take into account the width and height of each of these layers on the top, bottom, left and right in order to know what size your element will be.
